# Fix for "Database Error Saving New User" in Supabase

If you're encountering the **"Database error saving new user"** error during signup, follow these steps to resolve it:

## 1. Fix at the Supabase Level

First, run this SQL script in your Supabase SQL Editor to fix common permission and configuration issues:

1. Login to your [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com/)
2. Go to your project
3. Open the SQL Editor
4. Copy and paste the contents from the `fix-supabase-signup.sql` file
5. Click "Run"

## 2. Check Authentication Settings

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to **Authentication â†’ Settings**
2. Under **Email Auth**, check if you have any restrictive settings:
   - Consider temporarily disabling "Confirm email" for testing
   - Make sure your SMTP server is properly configured (if using custom email)

## 3. Test with a Brand New Email

Sometimes Supabase caches failed signup attempts:

1. Try signing up with a completely different email address
2. Use a simple username (avoid special characters)
3. Use a strong but simple password (at least 6 characters)

## 4. Check Supabase Service Status

1. Visit the [Supabase Status Page](https://status.supabase.com/)
2. See if there are any reported issues with Authentication

## 5. Free Tier Limitations

If you're on the free tier of Supabase, there are some limitations:

1. There's a limit to the number of users you can have
2. There are rate limits on API calls
3. The database and service may go into "hibernation" if not used for a period

## 6. Common Solutions That Work

If you're still experiencing issues, try these approaches:

### Option 1: Defer Profile Creation

We've updated the code to:
- Use minimal user data during signup
- Store additional details in localStorage
- Create the profile during the profile completion step instead of at signup

### Option 2: Create a Fresh Supabase Project

Sometimes starting with a fresh project resolves persistent issues:

1. Create a new Supabase project
2. Run our setup SQL script
3. Update your API keys in the application

### Option 3: Contact Supabase Support

If all else fails:
1. [Contact Supabase support](https://supabase.com/support)
2. Include the error message and steps to reproduce
3. Share your project reference ID

## Additional Troubleshooting

If you continue to experience issues:

1. Open your browser's Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to the Network tab
3. Find the signup request and examine the full error response
4. Check your Supabase project logs for more details

This error is usually related to Supabase's infrastructure or configuration rather than your code, so the SQL fixes and configuration changes are often the most effective solutions.
